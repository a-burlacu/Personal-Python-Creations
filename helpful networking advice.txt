Okay, so here is one way that you can secret your way into selling yourself without actually trying to sell a person on hiring you. I actually have gotten a few soft job offers by just like contacting project managers for things I find interesting by writing to tell them I am a student writing a report on a subject matter related to projects the company works for and asking to interview them. From there I set up short phone interviews where I could ask them about their experience in the field and discuss what makes someone a good applicant for them. Then in talking to them and asking questions and showing an interest in what they are doing I have had multiple instances of the people I am talking to specifically asking me if I could apply for things they had open because they thought I’d be a good fit.



One other super quick hack! ALL networking is a game you can play where YOU try to find ways to help the people you’re talking to. Not the other way around
